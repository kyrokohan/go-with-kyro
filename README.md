# Go With Kyro – Hands-On Guide

Welcome! This repository is a collection of practical, progressively challenging Go projects organized by difficulty. Each project focuses on a specific concept so you can learn by building.

## Repository structure

- **Difficulty folders**: `fundamentals`, `intermediate`, `advanced`, `expert`
- **Project naming**: `##-project-name` (e.g. `01-hello-cli`)
- **Companion repositories**
  - [`go-with-kyro`](https://github.com/kyrokohan/go-with-kyro) – _this repository_ with project descriptions only
  - [`go-with-kyro-solutions`](https://github.com/kyrokohan/go-with-kyro-solutions) – reference implementations for every project, each containing two solution modules:
    - `goal/` – completes the required goals only
    - `stretch/` – completes both the required and the stretch goals

## How to use this guide

1. Clone **both** repositories (or fork them) and keep them side-by-side on your machine.
2. Inside `go-with-kyro`, pick a project from the catalog below.
3. Open its `README.md`, read the requirements, and build your solution.
4. When you are happy with your work, open the corresponding folder in [`go-with-kyro-solutions`](https://github.com/kyrokohan/go-with-kyro-solutions) to compare with the official answer (start with `goal/`, then peek at `stretch/` when you are ready).

> ⚡️ Tip: Tackle the projects in order. They gently ramp up in difficulty.
