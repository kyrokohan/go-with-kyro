# Go With Kyro – Hands-On Guide

Welcome! This repository is a collection of practical, bite-sized Go mini-projects organised by difficulty. Each project focuses on a specific concept so you can learn by building.

## Repository structure

- **Difficulty folders**: `fundamentals`, `intermediate`, `advanced`, `expert`
- **Project naming**: `##-project-name` (e.g. `01-hello-cli`)
- **Branches**
  - `main` – starter files & exercise descriptions only
  - `solutions` – reference implementations for every project

## How to use this guide

1. Clone the repo (or fork it) and stay on the `main` branch.
2. Pick a project from the catalogue below.
3. Open its `README.md`, read the requirements, and build your solution.
4. When you are happy with your work, compare it with the official answer by switching to the `solutions` branch.

> ⚡️ Tip: Tackle the projects in order—they gently ramp up in difficulty.
